# Simple Shell, Checks 
Cohort 18 HOlberton Puerto Rico contributing to test suite, the whole class to work together and create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edged cases for each task.

| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Absolute paths | [01_simple_shell_0.1](./01_simple_shell_0.1) | `/bin/ls` |
| Random | [02_simple_shell_0.1.1](./02_simple_shell_0.1.1) | `.` | 
| Paths | [05_path_cases_0.3](./05_path_cases_0.3) | `ls` |
